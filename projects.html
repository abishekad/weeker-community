                            The Water and Sanitation program was done by WCDT with the help of funds provided from Wilde
                            Ganzen Organization and Stitching Sari Organization. We had many requests from local rural
                            poor schools in need for toilet facility since the school children did not have urinals and
                            restrooms so the students used public space for urinating thus causing a major health
                            hazard. Since poor sanitation can cause the spread of diseases, increased absenteeism and
                            poor academic performance we WCDT took this issue into our hands and started building
                            quality restrooms in four schools in rural villages namely Mathampattu, Irundai, Mugaiyur
                            and Sengamedu. This project eventually turned into a great society oriented one.

                            Nadu. In India most of the people above the age of 50 start getting Cataract due to various
                            reasons and the treatment for them in rural place is not much available which leads to
                            clouding, blurry, hazy and less colourful vision. Thus, an eye camp was organized with all
                            the equipment setup along with nurses and doctors where more than 200 participants got free
                            eye treatment and 18 people were taken to the hospital for further eye operation at free of
                            cost.
